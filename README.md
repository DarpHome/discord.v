## Examples

### Ping pong


```v
module main

import discord

fn main() {
	mut c := discord.bot(
		os.getenv_opt('DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN') or {
			eprintln('No token specified')
			exit(1)
		}
		intents: .message_content | .guild_messages | .direct_messages
	)
	c.events.on_ready.listen(fn (event discord.ReadyEvent) ! {
		println('Logged as ${event.user.username}! Bot has ${event.guilds.len} guilds')
	})
	c.events.on_message_create.listen(fn (event discord.MessageCreateEvent) ! {
		if event.message.content != '!ping' {
			return
		}
		event.creator.create_message(event.message.channel_id, content: 'Pong')!
	})
	c.launch()!
}
```

> Returning an error from event handler logs error, not panic the whole program.

> Don't forget toggle `Message Content` intent in Developer Portal! Otherwise, your bot will shutdown with error:
